HOW IT WORKS & design decisions

BECS:
    uses 'entity_SOA_t' as the base ecs
    - designed for contiguous memory
    - built in handles for spatial partioning/hashing systems

spatial partioning:
-> each entity should be registered upon creation via: 'register_entity'
    which hashes the bounding box to the grid space 

-> update registered entity bounding box if the entity changes its size or position
    to ensure optimal collision checks via: 'update_entity_bounding_box'
