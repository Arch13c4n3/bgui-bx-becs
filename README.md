this repo contains the headers and implementations for:

BGUI - basic gui - super fast minimal gui library for multi state components - still working on backend and some front-end layers

bx - basic physics - light weight physics solver - not implemented

becs - basic ecs - implemented entity_SOA_t with built in spatial hashing and handles

these headers are designed to be self contained with seemeless interoptability
