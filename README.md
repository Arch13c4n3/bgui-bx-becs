this repo contains the headers and implementations for:

🖼️BGUI - basic gui - super fast minimal gui library for multi state components - still working on backend and some front-end layers

👌bx - basic physics - light weight physics solver - not implemented , might use jolt 

💅becs - basic ecs - implemented entity_SOA_t with built in spatial hashing and handles

these headers are designed to be self contained with some seemeless interoptability 

currently uses raylib -> plans to move to webgpu(dawn) / vulkan / sokol
